# Pac-Man using an STM32F401RE

This project showcases a classic Pac-Man game implemented on an STM32 Nucleo Board, utilizing a 20x4 LCD display for game visuals. The game leverages the I2C protocol to interface with the LCD and employs ADC DMA for joystick inputs, ensuring responsive control. Additional features include game sound effects generated by a buzzer and GPIO inputs for interactive gameplay.

### Terminologies
- DDRAM: Display Data RAM which stores the character to be shown at particular positions. Since I am using a 16x2 display, 32 characters can be shown.

## Materials
1. 2004 I2C LCD (Character Display Module LCD - Color I2C 99.00mm x 60.00mm x 22.00mm)
2. ANALOG 2-AXIS THUMB JOYSTICK WIT
3. BUZZER PIEZO 3V 12.2MM TH
4. BREADBRD TERM STRIP 3.20X2.00"
5. Wires to connect

## Connections
- The LCD has four connections: GND, VCC, SDA, and SCL
  - In STM32CubeMX, PB9 is set to I2C1_SDA (SDA/D14) and PB8 (SCL/D15) is set to I2C_SCL
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88de7ac6-46ff-428b-a5d1-e7ca8b57d041)
- The joystick has 5 connections: GND, VCC, SEL, XOUT, and YOUT
  - SEL is set as GPIO_Input on PA10 (D2)
  - XOUT is set as ADC1_IN11 on PC1 (A4)
  - YOUT is set as ADC1_IN10 on PC0 (A5)
- The buzzer is set as GPIO_Input on PB10 (PWM/D6)

## LCD with PCF8574
The PCF8574 expansion allows for easier setup of the data transfer between the display and the microcontroller board. The display itself has the following pins: VSS, VDD, V0, RS (0 for command and 1 for data), R/W, E (enable signal), D0 - D7 pins, A, and K.

The most important pins are the RS, R/W and the E signals as they depend on the instruction being sent to or from the display. If the bits are an instruction, RS is 0. E should be 1 when the data is being sent and must be set to 1 after data transfer to notify of the end of transfer.

To use the I2C protocol, a [LCD I2C library](https://controllerstech.com/i2c-lcd-in-stm32/) was imported to the project. The three functions that I have referred to are: lcd_send_cmd, lcd_send_data, and lcd_init. The rest of the functions were written by me using the data sheet.

### Library Functions
- clear_display (void)
  - This clears the display data, resets the address counter, and returns the cursor to the top left of the display.
- return_home (void)
  - Move the cursor to the top left of the display.
- entry_mode (int dir, int s)
  - Cursor direction
  - I/D: Increment (move the cursor to right) or decrement (move the cursor to left) the address of DDRAM
  - S: Shift the display left or right
- display_on_off (int d, int c, int b)
  - Turn the display on or off (data is not lost)
  - No cursor displayed (just a visual thing)
  - Cursor blink
- function_set (int dl, int n int f)
  - 8-bit or 4 bit
  - 0 for 1 display line and 1 for 2 display lines
  - Font style 5x8 or 5x11
## Joystick Setup
The joystick has analog outputs for x and y and a sel signal that shorts to zero when the button is pressed. To get the inputs of the joystick, I used ADC with DMA to continuously receive analog inputs. This was configured in CubeMX with the following settings:

- Resolution - 12 bits: it has 4096 levels.
- Data Alignment - Right Alignment: 12 bits are stored in the lower 12 bits of a 16 bit register.
- Scan Conversion Mode - Enabled: allows data from multiple channels to be converted without user intervention.
- Continuous Conversion Mode - Enabled: continuous conversion of data.
- Discontinuous Conversion Mode - Disable: conversions of data with pauses (that can allow the CPU to do other tasks).
- DMA Continuous Requests - Enabled: allow ADC to convert data and send to memory without the need of the CPU.
- Number of Conversion - 2: number of ADC channels
- External Trigger Conversion Source - regular Conversion launched by software: the trigger that will initiate the ADC conversion. In this case, the software will just automatically send constant software signals to convert.
- Sampling Time - 84 Cycles: the amount of time spent by the ADC to sample data. It will take 84 cycles to sample the joystick data which is pretty long.

The joystick input values range from 0 to 4100. So a function was created to run inside the main loop to continuously check for the joystick position.

## Timers
TIM1 was used to move the enemy. TIM3 was used to generate the PWM for the buzzer.

## Game Algorithm
The big picture of the game algorithm is:
- Structs that define the player, enemy (AKA Ghost), game status, and the direction of the player.
- Functions that update the player and enemy locations, checks for game status, and processes the direction of the player.
- Very easy to understand, so I will skip explaining that part in this document, but I have included enough comments for people to understand :D
